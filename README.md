## System Overview

Perspective-AI is designed to combat the echo chambers created by personalized content algorithms. It actively curates counterarguments and alternative narratives from credible sources alongside the content you usually see. Whether it’s a news article, blog post, or social media update, Perspective-AI analyzes the existing narrative and presents a balanced, in-depth counter-perspective. This approach not only challenges your current viewpoints but also helps broaden your understanding of complex issues—all in real time.

### High-Level Concept
Imagine having a smart, opinionated friend who isn’t afraid to challenge your beliefs with well-articulated counterpoints—that’s Perspective-AI in a nutshell!

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend Layer
- **Next.js UI**: A sleek, responsive interface that displays content alongside counter perspectives.

### 3. Core Backend
- **FastAPI Server**: A high-performance API server handling requests, content analysis, and response delivery.
- **Content Analyzer**: Processes incoming articles or posts to identify the dominant narrative.
- **Counter-Narrative Engine**: Uses advanced AI and NLP techniques to generate alternative perspectives and reasoned analyses.

### 4. AI & NLP Integration
- **LLM Service**: Leverages large language models (e.g., OpenAI, custom models) to generate detailed counterarguments.
- **LangChain & Langgraph**: Frameworks to manage chains of reasoning and workflow orchestration for coherent narrative generation.

### 5. Data Storage
- **VectorDB**: A vector database for storing semantic embeddings to efficiently retrieve and compare content.
